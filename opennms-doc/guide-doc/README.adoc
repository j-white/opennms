= Documentation overview module
This module will give a quick overview to help you write or contribute documentation for the OpenNMS project.

== Building documentation
The documentation is integrated into the build process of OpenNMS. The documentation is compliled from AsciiDoc source into HTML files and is then distributed to http://docs.opennms.org[docs.opennms.org].

== Build from source
You can build the documentation from the source. Compiling from source requires the following components:

* either the Java Development Kit 1.6+, OpenJDK or Oracle Java
* Maven
* Internet connectivity for downloading the package dependencies with Maven

== Get the source code
Check out the source code from github using:

[source]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/OpenNMS/opennms.git
----

Change into the directory `opennms-doc` with the commands:

[source]
----
$ cd opennms/opennms-doc/doc-overview
$ mvn clean install
----

Maven will compile the AsciiDoc source files into HTML. For example, the output for the `doc-overview` module is generated in:

    ${OPENNMS_SOURCE}/opennms-doc/doc-overview/target/generated-docs/overview.html

You can open the `overview.html` with your browser.
